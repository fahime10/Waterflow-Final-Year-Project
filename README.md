# Waterflow-Final-Year-Project
## What the project is about
This project is a website that acts as a task manager for companies.
The objective was to create a simple workflow management system that any small company can use to manage and assign 
tasks to employees.
There are 4 clearance levels, Supermanager, Manager, Employee and Stakeholder.
Supermanager should be able to handle users information as well as making any changes to any projects saved in the 
database.
Manager is able to initiate a project and assign tasks to Employees.
Employee should only be able to view tasks and declare if they have been completed or not.
Stakeholder should only be able to view their own projects, but cannot make any changes.

## Requirements to make the application work
The database utilised to develop this application is MariaDB. Once this application has been downloaded, the user is 
required to configure the settings, such as updating the SQL script with the desired username and password and update 
the company username email and email password. Once these details have been set up, and the database created, then the
application should run as normal.
Other requirements involve the need for the vendor directory, which contains files required to make the SLIM 
framework work, and the composer.json is also required.

## Image resources
Although most of the aesthetics is done using CSS, the image used for the icon is from "Vecteezy.com".
